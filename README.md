# GeorgeCodes404

Hey — I'm George. Minty to some.  
I build web stuff with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Sometimes React or Express. Then I break it. Then I fix it. That’s the cycle, baby.

> “I write code, call myself a dumbass for 15 minutes, fix it, and call it a good day.”

🛠️ 3 years of building, breaking, and learning  
📱 Still beefing with mobile breakpoints, but we’re getting there  
🎯 Clean layouts, fast sites, and code that *works*  
💼 Currently freelancing + building my portfolio + trying not to scream at Flexbox
